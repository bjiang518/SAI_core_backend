# Privacy Permissions Required

## âœ… Photo Library Access - COMPLETED

The app now includes photo library access functionality. The required privacy permissions have been added to both Xcode project configurations.

### âœ… Added Privacy Keys:

1. **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** âœ…
   - Value: "StudyAI needs access to your photo library to let you upload homework images for AI analysis."
   - **Status: ADDED** to both StudyAI.xcodeproj and StudyAI_working.xcodeproj

2. **NSCameraUsageDescription** âœ… (already present)
   - Value: "StudyAI needs camera access to scan homework questions and documents."

### Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

- âœ… **PhotoPermissionManager** class handles runtime permission requests
- âœ… **ImageSourceSelectionView** provides both camera and photo library options  
- âœ… **PhotoLibraryPicker** handles photo selection from device library
- âœ… **Privacy permissions** added to Xcode project configurations
- âœ… **Error handling** with Settings redirect when permission denied

### How It Works:

1. User taps "ðŸ“¸ Scan or Upload Homework" in AIHomeworkTestView
2. ImageSourceSelectionView appears with two options:
   - **Take Photo** (blue) - Opens camera scanner
   - **Choose from Library** (green) - Opens photo picker
3. If user chooses "Choose from Library":
   - App requests photo library permission automatically
   - On first use, iOS shows permission dialog with your custom message
   - If granted, photo picker opens for image selection
   - If denied, user sees alert directing them to Settings

### âœ… Ready to Use

The photo library upload feature is now fully functional. Users can:
- Upload existing images from their device
- Camera scanning remains available as before
- Proper permission handling with user-friendly messages
- Seamless integration with existing AI homework parsing workflow

The crash issue has been resolved by adding the required NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key to the project configuration.
