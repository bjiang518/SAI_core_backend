Subject-Specific Parsing Rules for Homework Image Processing

This module provides specialized parsing rules for different subjects.
Each subject has unique question types and answer formats that require
specific extraction rules.

Architecture:
- Base prompt: VISION FIRST + 7 question types (universal)
- Subject rules: Additional rules specific to each subject
- Default: "General" subject with universal rules only

Supported Subjects (13 total):
- STEM Calculation: Math, Physics, Chemistry
- STEM Concept: Science, Biology, Computer Science
- Language Arts: English, Foreign Language
- Social Sciences: History, Geography
- Creative Arts: Art, Music, Physical Education

📖 ENGLISH-SPECIFIC PARSING RULES
================================================================================

RULE 1 - SPELLING ERRORS (CRITICAL):
✅ Extract exactly: "elefant" (even if wrong)
❌ Don't correct to: "elephant"
→ AI will grade spelling, not parse
→ Student's actual writing is what matters

RULE 2 - PUNCTUATION PRESERVATION:
✅ Keep all punctuation: periods, commas, quotation marks, apostrophes
→ Example: "I like summer because it's warm."
→ Don't add or remove punctuation

RULE 3 - MULTI-BLANK SENTENCES (Fill-in-the-Blank):
Format: "The boy _____ at _____ with his _____."
Student wrote: "is playing", "home", "dad"
→ student_answer: "is playing | home | dad" (use | separator)

RULE 4 - LONG ANSWERS (Essays/Paragraphs):
IF student wrote paragraph(s):
→ question_type: "long_answer"
→ Extract complete text with line breaks
→ Preserve capitalization and punctuation

RULE 5 - CIRCLED WORDS (Grammar Questions):
IF student circled/underlined answer in text:
→ Extract only the circled word(s): "runs"
→ Don't include surrounding text

RULE 6 - READING COMPREHENSION STRUCTURE (CRITICAL):
IF you see:
- Long passage (2+ paragraphs) at top of page
- Followed by numbered questions (1, 2, 3...) referring to the passage
THEN:
→ is_parent: true
→ has_subquestions: true
→ parent_content: [the full reading passage text]
→ subquestions: [the numbered comprehension questions with student answers]
→ Example structure:
   "Read the following passage and answer the questions:
    [3 paragraphs about mountains...]
    1. What is the main idea?
    2. Where does this take place?"

   Should parse as:
   - parent_content: "Read the following passage... [full passage text]"
   - subquestions: [
       {id: "1", question_text: "What is the main idea?", student_answer: "..."},
       {id: "2", question_text: "Where does this take place?", student_answer: "..."}
     ]

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Passage text goes in parent_content, NOT as a separate question
- Only the numbered questions become subquestions
- Don't create a "question 0" for the passage itself

RULE 7 - COMPOSITION/ESSAY PROMPTS (CRITICAL):
IF you see:
- Writing prompt/topic at top (e.g., "Write about your favorite season")
- Followed by multi-paragraph student response (essay/composition)
THEN:
→ question_text: [the writing prompt/topic]
→ student_answer: [entire student essay with all paragraphs]
→ question_type: "long_answer"
→ Preserve paragraph breaks with newlines (\n)

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Don't split essay into multiple questions (one per paragraph)
- Capture the COMPLETE student response as one answer
- Keep original formatting and line breaks

Examples:
- Prompt: "Describe your summer vacation"
  Answer: [All 3-4 paragraphs student wrote]

- Prompt: "Write a letter to your friend"
  Answer: [Complete letter from "Dear..." to "Sincerely..."]
