# Monthly Reports: Value Proposition & Design Specification

**Date:** February 8, 2026
**Version:** 1.0 - Initial Design
**Status:** 🎨 Design Phase - Defining new insights, UI, and report structure

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Weekly Reports** = Tactical feedback ("What happened this week?")
- **Monthly Reports** = Strategic insights ("How am I progressing long-term?")

Monthly reports should NOT be "weekly reports with more data". They should provide **fundamentally different insights** that only become visible over 30+ days of learning data.

---

## Part 1: New Insights for Monthly Reports

### 1. Learning Velocity & Acceleration 📈

**What it is:**
Track how fast the student is improving over time, not just current performance.

**Metrics:**
- **Velocity**: Rate of accuracy improvement (% per week)
- **Acceleration**: Is improvement speeding up or slowing down?
- **Trajectory**: Linear, exponential, or plateau?

**Example Insights:**
- "Your math accuracy improved 8% this month, accelerating from 5% last month"
- "You're on track to reach 90% accuracy in algebra by March"
- "Science learning has plateaued - time to increase challenge level"

**Why Monthly Only:**
Need 4+ data points (weeks) to calculate meaningful trends and acceleration.

**Visualization:**
Trend line chart with velocity indicators and projected trajectory.

---

### 2. Subject Mastery Progression 🎓

**What it is:**
Track movement through skill levels (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Master).

**Metrics:**
- **Mastery Level**: Current skill tier per subject
- **Skill Progression**: Movement between tiers
- **Breadth vs Depth**: Master of one vs proficient in many

**Example Insights:**
- "You advanced from Intermediate to Advanced in Algebra this month"
- "You're now proficient in 5 subjects (up from 3 last month)"
- "You're a Master in 2 areas but still Beginner in 4 - consider focusing efforts"

**Why Monthly Only:**
Mastery takes time to build - weekly fluctuations don't reflect true skill level.

**Skill Tier Definitions:**
- **Beginner** (0-50%): Still learning fundamentals
- **Intermediate** (50-70%): Solid understanding, occasional mistakes
- **Advanced** (70-85%): Confident, rare mistakes
- **Master** (85-95%): Deep understanding, teaching level
- **Expert** (95%+): Exceptional mastery

**Visualization:**
Progress bars per subject with tier badges, heatmap showing breadth of knowledge.

### 3. Learning Habits & Consistency Patterns 📅

**What it is:**
Identify routines, streaks, and habit formation patterns.

**Metrics:**
- **Consistency Score**: How regular is study schedule (0-100)
- **Best Study Days**: Which days of week are most productive
- **Best Study Times**: Morning, afternoon, evening patterns
- **Streak Analysis**: Current streak, longest streak, streak breaks
- **Routine Strength**: How predictable is the schedule

**Example Insights:**
- "You study most effectively on Tuesdays and Thursdays (85% avg accuracy)"
- "Your longest study streak was 12 days (Jan 10-21)"
- "You're most focused between 6-8 PM (90% accuracy vs 75% morning)"
- "Study sessions on weekends are 30% longer but 10% less accurate"

**Why Monthly Only:**
Need full weeks of data to detect day-of-week and time-of-day patterns.

**Visualization:**
Calendar heatmap showing activity patterns, clock diagram showing best times, streak timeline.

---

### 4. Burnout Detection & Recovery Analysis 🔥

**What it is:**
Identify chronic stress patterns (vs acute weekly stress) and recovery effectiveness.

**Metrics:**
- **Burnout Risk Score**: Sustained high frustration + declining performance (0-100)
- **Recovery Time**: How long to bounce back from difficult periods
- **Resilience Score**: Ability to maintain performance under stress
- **Warning Signs**: Patterns that predict upcoming burnout

**Example Insights:**
- "Burnout risk is MODERATE (65/100) - sustained frustration for 18 days"
- "You recovered from your mid-month slump in 4 days (faster than 6 days last month)"
- "Warning: Similar patterns preceded your February burnout - take breaks now"

**Red Flags (Monthly-Specific):**
- 15+ days of sustained frustration (vs 3+ days weekly)
- Accuracy declining 3 weeks in a row
- Study time dropping while question difficulty constant
- No "fun" learning sessions for 20+ days

**Why Monthly Only:**
Burnout is a chronic condition - weekly reports catch acute stress, monthly catches burnout.

**Visualization:**
Burnout timeline showing risk levels over time, recovery curve analysis.

- **Optimal Review Timing**: When should concepts be reviewed
- **Forgetting Curve**: How quickly knowledge fades
- **Long-term Mastery**: Topics mastered 30+ days ago still strong

**Example Insights:**
- "You retained 85% of algebra concepts from 3 weeks ago (excellent!)"
- "Geometry concepts fade after 10 days - recommend weekly reviews"
- "Topics studied with spaced repetition had 25% better retention"

**Why Monthly Only:**
Need 3-4 week intervals to measure meaningful retention and forgetting curves.

**Visualization:**
Retention curves per subject, optimal review schedule calendar.

---

### 6. Cross-Subject Knowledge Synthesis 🔗

**What it is:**
Identify when learning in one subject helps another (transfer learning).

**Metrics:**
- **Positive Transfer**: Improved subject B after studying subject A
- **Concept Overlap**: Shared topics across subjects (e.g., fractions in math and science)
- **Learning Synergy**: Combined subjects learned faster than separate

**Example Insights:**
- "Your algebra progress accelerated chemistry learning (equations transfer)"
- "History comprehension improved after reading fiction (shared skill: analysis)"
- "Math and physics show 40% concept overlap - studying together is efficient"

**Why Monthly Only:**
Need diverse question set across multiple subjects to detect patterns.

**Visualization:**
Network graph showing subject connections, synergy matrix.
